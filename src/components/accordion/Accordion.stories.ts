Indicative monthly payment excl the Annual Fee and assumes no additional purchases, cash advances or other fees and no interest applies. 

  Indicative monthly payment is a minimum monthly repayment (MMP) of the greater of $30 or 3% of the outstanding balance for the first month, as the first monthâ€™s MMP is greater than the Transaction amount divided by the Interest Free Period. The MMP decreases each month as the Eligible Unpaid Balance decreases, therefore the purchase price of the Transaction will not be repaid within the Interest Free Period if you only pay the contractual MMP over the entire Interest Free Period.
